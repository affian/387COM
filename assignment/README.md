# 387COM Assignment

Issue Date: 28th September 2015

Deadline: 18 December 2015

Grade Contribution: 100%

## Brief

You are briefed with designing, building and testing a smartphone app that demonstrates your proficiency in the skills you have been taught during the lab sessions. Ultimately the choice of app is entirely up to you however it is your responsibility to ensure that the app you decide to build will give you sufficient scope to demonstrate the required skills. These are described in the **Smartphone Grading Rubric** which you can access on Moodle.

### App Ideas

1. a University tour guide to help people find important places and useful information.
2. a treasure hunt app that provides clues to a location within the University and City. Once the user arrives in the correct location they get a fresh clue to a different location...
3. a paper-trail app where one person tries to escape and the pursuers try to locate him or her.

## Submission

### Video

You are required to record a *screencast* in which you are expected to both demonstrate the features of your app and also explain key code behind it. You will only be awarded marks for features demonstrated in the video. There are a number of restrictions:

1. the video must last no longer than 8 minutes
2. the video quality must be at least 720HD
3. the video must me uploaded to YouTube with privacy set to **unlisted**.

### Repository

You must also provide a link to a **BitBucket** repository to allow staff to both view and download your code as well as to check for any *plagiarism* or *collusion*. You must provide **reporter** access to:
1. marktyers
2. jianhuayang

### Note

The App should be developed using the **native development tools and languages** taught in the labs, you must not use any other languages or tools. If you make use of any code from any other sources (tutorials, help sites, etc) this must be clearly indicated in your source code.

You must not share any of your assignment code with your fellow students. We use a sophisticated tool that can identify similarities between submissions. If these are detected, **both** parties will be referred to the **Academic Conduct Office (ACO)** for collusion.
