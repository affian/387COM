# Unit Testing
## Worksheet

Example using the Notes class and NoteSet singleton class.

Need to modify the target membership under file inspector to add both classes to the tests membership.

Adding a test failure breakpoint

This breakpoint stops the execution when the test posts a failure assertion, helping to identify the point of failure.
