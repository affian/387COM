# Frameworks
## Worksheet

In this worksheet you will be developing apps for third-party wearables. During this process you will learn about.

1. Integrating third-party frameworks into your apps
2. Building bridging header files to allow you to use Objective-C libraries in your Swift programming

You will be developing apps that connect to and make use of the features of the **Microsoft Band**. The exercises cannot run on a simulator, you need to use an iOS device running the latest version of iOS and connected to a *Microsoft Band* via Bluetooth. Specifically you will learn how to:

1. Access the data from the accelerometer and gyroscope
2. Communicate with the wearer using haptic feedback

You should already understand the following:

1. the syntax of **closures** in Swift
2. implementing **protocols**
