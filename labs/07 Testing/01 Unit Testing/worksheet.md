Example using the Notes class and NoteSet singleton class.

Need to modify the target membership under file inspector to add both classes to the tests membership.

Can test View Controllers

Sample working tests in the ToDo project covering testing View Controllers
Sample working tests in the Note Well project covering testing models (including singletons).

exercise based on adding book favourites (topic 3) to singleton. check for duplicates.
async method to return info on book from list via googleapis.
adding book id that doesnt exist.

Adding a test failure breakpoint

This breakpoint stops the execution when the test posts a failure assertion, helping to identify the point of failure.
